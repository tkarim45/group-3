Landed a Remote Job When I Least Expected It,"Around January 14th, my previous company asked the entire department to put in their papers. As per policy, we had only a one-month notice period. It was an onsite role, and throughout my six-year professional journey (except during Covid), I had only worked onsite jobs. So, I never really had a strong inclination towards either onsite or remote jobs‚ÄîI just took whatever came my way.

This layoff came out of nowhere, and honestly, I went insane. Just to give you some context‚ÄîI‚Äôm a family person with financial commitments and liabilities. So, I started applying like crazy‚Äî25 to 30 jobs every day. At one point, I even stopped reading job descriptions properly. I would just look at the title, skim through the description, and apply. In total, I applied for around 400 jobs in two weeks.

I don‚Äôt know how others apply, but for those 14 days, I completely locked myself out from the world‚Äîno social media, no TV, no friends, nothing. It was just me fighting my situation. I didn‚Äôt even tell anyone because I didn‚Äôt want those sympathetic reactions; they only gave me more anxiety.

After a week of this madness, I started getting interview calls, mostly for onsite roles, along with a few first-round interviews. Out of the 400 jobs I applied for, I got responses from around 20. Most were onsite roles, with a few remote ones in the mix.

When it came to interviews, my approach was simple‚Äîgive my best. I even worked on my vocal delivery and camera setup to ensure I left a good impression. One day, I got an email from a company I had applied to. They were interested in my profile, and after four rounds of interviews, I got the offer. Luckily, this happened within my notice period, and I felt so relieved.

Surprisingly, I couldn‚Äôt crack a single onsite role. I interviewed for three remote jobs and ended up getting offers from two. I was like, WTF is going on? Everyone says remote jobs are harder to get, but for me, it was the opposite.

I‚Äôm not some super-talented person‚Äîjust an average guy with strong willpower who‚Äôs always ready to put in the hard work when needed. I just want to say‚Äîkeep doing what you have to do and don‚Äôt overthink things that are out of your control. Whatever is meant to happen will happen.

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a job. You have to work, whether it‚Äôs onsite or remote. Nothing in this world is permanent‚Äîjust do your karma, and nature will take care of the rest.

Also I can't share my story with my family and friends, so I am putting it here",Current_Scarcity6611,2025-02-16 02:14:46,97,RemoteWork

How Remote Jobs Have Changed in the Last 3 Years: Not All Sunshine and Rainbows,"I've been reflecting on how remote work has evolved over the past few years, and honestly, it's been a mixed bag. Remember when remote jobs felt like the ultimate dream? Well, things have shifted, and not always for the better.

First off, the rise in scammers and spammers is unreal. It feels like every other job posting is a trap. You have to be super vigilant, and it‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs like navigating a minefield just to find a legit opportunity.

Then there‚Äôs the job security issue. Companies seem to have no qualms about letting people go at the drop of a hat. The flexibility that once felt freeing now feels a bit precarious. You never know when the rug might be pulled out from under you.

Sure, the pay and management have improved in some places, but that doesn‚Äôt always translate to reliability. The constant uncertainty can be stressful, and it‚Äôs hard to feel settled when things are so unpredictable.",Head-Safe-2269,2025-02-16 08:57:49,1,RemoteWork

How to maintain work-life balance while working with a company that has meetings in my night time,"It took me many years of trial and error to figure out what I needed to have good work-life balance while working from home, and it was this: strict start and end times for work. No more Slack/Teams after working hours.

Now I recently started working with a company where we have zero working hours overlap (unlike in the past), so I am supposed to always have meeting at my 9.30pm, 10.30 pm, sometimes meetings that end at my midnight.

This has really messed up my work-life balance. I need a routine that I can follow again. I can't work in day time on days where I don't have meetings and then not on days where I do. It messes my sleep time.

If I think that maybe everyday I work during night hours, so that I have the day to myself at least, but everyone else at my home is busy during day time so I can't spend quality time with them during day time.

Do any of you face similar issues? What has worked for you?

Asking the company to change meeting times is not possible. ",Opposite-Tax9589,2025-02-16 03:45:23,4,RemoteWork

Looking for Opportunity,"Hi, I'm Muhammad. I'm a Web and App Developer living in Malaysia as a refugee and I'm 18 years old.

What I can do:

Build websites using Next.js and React

Make mobile apps with React Native

Work with databases (SQL and NoSQL)

Create and connect APIs

True Noise Canceling Headphones?,"I sometimes work from home with a very loud and disruptive toddler without a room I can go into for quiet focused time (my wife is a stay-at-home-mom who is with him all day).

They are only 5 years old, but I have to turn the volume up to unhealthy levels to drown out noise in my house.

Standing desk you‚Äôd never buy again?,"IKEA Bezant is the worst desk ever exist. The laminate top doesn't hold up well to moisture so I have to clean spills up quickly or it starts peeling. Bigger issue? it‚Äôs over loaded cause my computers are sitting too much weight on one leg. It seems OK but it lifts slowly, sometimes stop, then drops very fast and even reverse from time to time. Tired of it!

So, any actually standing desk out there? Let's compare to cars and say IKEA is a Mazda SUV. Looks good, terrible sometimes until you realize there are BMW X4s and Porsche Macans and then a whole other level with Bentleys and shit like that. So what's the Rolls Royce of desks?",supershadrach,2025-02-13 09:39:40,10,WorkFromHome
Maternity leave and work - feeling isolated,"Hello, I'm (28F) 30 weeks pregnant and feeling super isolated at work and not sure what to do. I want to know if this is normal experience for a pregnant person about to go on maternity leave?

I have worked here for 8 months, found out I was pregnant pretty early on and told work when I'd been there 5 months. I passed by 6 month probation fine. They have no idea how my job works. They know it's very important but I don't have a manager to fall back on to ask anything. My manager was a senior business analyst which has nothing to do with my job.

The role was previously very high level manager before but got defunded to the position it is now, and instead of a team of 2-5 it's now just me so I have been VERY stressed. My manager decided I would be better off in the web development team which now has 5 staff and the manager there is absolutely swamped. I haven't had a proper 1:1 in 4 months. No handover or intro meeting to the new manager (I know them personally) but I haven't had any meeting with them regarding properly joining their team calls/meetings or anything about me about to go on maternity leave.

It feels like everyone is ignoring me until I leave or there's no point talking to me (10-11 more weeks of this treatment feels a little painful) I'm just wondering if anyone else got this? I know it can be annoying for the staff who aren't 'going away' for 9 months but it's just generally sucks having emails ignored by old manager, new manager and their manager. Teams messaged left on read about projects I'm doing. They don't care because they have no idea how my job works.

They also decided not to hire anyone for my maternity cover, which I'm not too concerned about I think they are consulting with higher management to reconsider the position being in their teams or something else I don't know. No one will tell me anything about it and I feel very alone right now. I kind of expected it but is this normal behaviour when they know you're going in  3 months time? Although it has been like this since I told them and only gotten more and more ignored as time has gone on.

My holiday requests are also ignored and I can't talk to my manager about when I return or using accrued holiday because he's too busy. What do I do?

I have mentally checked out a bit but I still have 30 odd people chasing me at any one time, as like I said the role is very important to other staff just not to my managers.  I can't progress stuff though because I either need to pay for something to progress a project or need approval but it's just met on deaf ears!

Thanks for any advice!",No_Ask_1220,2025-02-13 16:47:05,0,WorkFromHome
Plug & Play Webcam Recommendations?,"I'm \*finally\* investing some time and money into making my workspace more ergonomically suited to my body.

I originally tried to use my GoPro (because I already own one), but IT was not on board with downloading GoPro's webcam software. SO- no I'm in the market for a plug-and-play webcam that will work with my laptops native software. Any recommendations? Thanks in advance. ",mollyjeanne,2025-02-13 16:39:30,0,WorkFromHome

Would this interest remote workers ?,"Hello everyone,

I've recently been having remote meetings where we needed to record our meetings and take notes so actions can be shared and put in a task management plateform. With that in mind we decided to use a note taking AI app but felt dissatisfied by what's available.

Fulltime RTO Will Help Make America Healthy Again!,"
Dear RFK Jr.,

I am not a health professional or advocate, so I'd like to get some insight related to the fulltime return to office mandate being imposed on so many Americans. I assume the decision to enforce this mandate kept the mission of MAHA, ""Make America Healthy Again"", entirely in mind. 

Once the president's goal of obliterating the workplace benefit of telework with the feds is done, it's likely that the focus will then shift to pressuring the private industry to do the same. 

That said, in hopes of getting a better grasp on how to achieve optimal health, can you please confirm that the factors listed below definitely will NOT make a negative impact on America's quest to achieve better health, both mentally and physically?

1. Breathing in recycled air shared by hundreds for nine consecutive hours in a building that also may contain asbestos.
2. Sitting/Standing behind a computer screen for nine consecutive hours in an environment with harsh lighting. 
3. Sitting still for an additional two to three hours during the commute.
4. Drinking water in a building that has history of legionella or cutting the amount of water consumed throughout the day because buying bottled water is not economical. 
5. Decreasing the quality and quantity of daily sleep significantly.
6. Cutting out regular exercise out of necessity.
7. Being increasingly agitated by the constant frivolous gossiping or other unproductive chatter that occurs daily at the office.
8. Combatting all the ineffective office noise and distractions to finally try to get something done daily.
9. Riding on public transit where people are tightly packed like sardines, if taking that mode of transportation in. 
10. Increasing blood pressure daily while sitting in traffic that's worse than before because an increased volume of cars are on the road, if driving in.
11. Straining daily to navigate around the all to common road rage of others which will likely increase due to the increase in traffic volume, if driving in.
12. Feeling pain daily in knowing after all that, I would have been more effective and productive teleworking. 
13. Elevating my overall stress and fatigue levels.
14. Racing the clock with heightened stress trying to make it to my kids' activities.
15. Seeing my children for far less each day.

All of these factors will certainly help US get on the path to ""Make America Healthy Again"", right!? 

Respectfully,

A Working Class American

Where to live?,"Alright everyone, so I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have a fully remote role which allows me to live and work in any of the lower 48 states of the US. I‚Äôm not 100% sure on Alaska or Hawaii. 

I‚Äôm unmarried with no kids, and my outdoor hobbies often involve two wheels (bicycle or motorcycle). I do semi-frequently travel for work, taking about 30 round trip flights/year to various parts of the country so I‚Äôd like to be within about an hour of a commercial airport.

I‚Äôm currently in CA and am pretty spoiled by the generally moderate weather, comparatively. But I‚Äôm also recognizing that rent/housing is expensive here and I‚Äôm paying a decent chunk in state income taxes. Moving to a less expensive area would effectively give me a decent pay raise due to lower COL.

"I was tired of begging for referrals, so I built a tool that shows me every job where I already have an inside connection.","I felt like I am sitting on a gold mine of job referrals but can't effectively tap into it.

Here's the frustrating reality I faced: I had connections working at great companies, but my job search process was backwards. I'd find interesting positions first, then painfully scroll through LinkedIn trying to find if I knew anyone there. Hours wasted, opportunities missed, and motivation crushed.

So I built a solution that flips this around: a tool that automatically scans job openings at companies where my LinkedIn connections already work. Instead of:

1. Find job ‚Üí 2. Search network ‚Üí 3. Maybe find a connection ‚Üí 4. Reach out

Now it's:

1. See job opening + matching connection instantly ‚Üí 2. Reach out for referral

It's like having a personal matchmaker that knows both where your connections work AND where the openings are. No more manual searching, no more missed opportunities.

I was wondering if people would like to use this ?

Some people have been over reporting hours of work. Yes I do approve their payroll and yes I can't help noticing this and no I'm not in management so I could always play dumb. Would you be comfortable witnessing this?,"Popular consensus seems to be, let it go, mind your own business, not your money, not your business, you won't get anywhere with it, etc. Kinda after a second opinion haha.

I've already alerted management and we seem to have a performance management issue, that doesn‚Äôt quite resolve.

So pretty much nobody likes a snitch and we should just keep approving the payroll/hours and get on with it. So is this what it is or would anyone offer any advice to do more about it?

Any tips for headsets users?,"So for context I was working a remote position where I pretty much had to take calls all day, and my previous company had some pretty light headsets (although they seemed very cheap and the quality wasn't the best) and I never experienced that many issues, but after switching to another company that pays better their requirements were a bit higher, my new headphones are bigger, heavier and definitely better quality, but while wearing them through my regular 8hrs shift I started noticing some discomfort around the area where it touches the top of my head no matter how much or how little I adjust them and the area remains sort of sore if I touch it even after my shift ends and I'm not wearing them anymore, I'm just mainly concerned about it because I remember those videos of the streamers shaving their heads revealing dents caused by their headsets and I just feel like the pressure over time might start causing hair loss, and I'm kind of not really looking forward to that lol, so if anyone knows about any tips to make this better or avoid it altogether that would be greatly appreciated. 

I'm willing to take suggestions for headsets replacements as well if any of you has had good experiences with any, the only requirements for my position is that they can't be wireless, and they have to offer some sort of noise cancellation.

Went from remote to hybrid‚Ä¶ how exhausting,"Since before COVID, I remember how exhausted I used to be in my 20s going to the office. I used to think it was because of my commute which was 40 minutes with no traffic, but usually about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. 

But then I went remote and felt like I got so much of my life back. In 2025, we went hybrid again and now I go in 3 days a week. I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal because now I live about five minutes away from the office.

But was I in for a surprise. I come home from work at around four and go in at like 830. This is a pretty cool schedule for the most part but I still find myself burnt out barely able to move as soon as I get home, not even able to think 

The ironic part is this is the easiest job I‚Äôve ever had. I don‚Äôt feel any pressure for management. Everyone seems really cool but something about going in is just soul crushing.

Does anyone have any tips? What could it be? I didn‚Äôt go in dreading the situation and even now I just think well it is what it is so I don‚Äôt imagine that this is psychological. I sit at a desk all day so it‚Äôs not physical. I get a good amount of sleep and I eat properly and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what is causing the exhaustion .",Adventurous-Cash2044,2025-02-14 02:29:01,360,RemoteWork

Rant Alert: Why Is It So Damn Hard to Find a Fully Remote PM Job?!,"I‚Äôve been searching for¬†months¬†for a¬†truly remote product management job¬†that lets me¬†work from anywhere, and I feel like I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end. üò©



A Bit About Me:

* I have¬†4+ years of experience as a Product Manager & Data Analyst¬†at a leading B2C logistics marketplace platform in India.
* I want to train¬†Muay Thai in Thailand, and get my¬†Divemaster certification, all while working remotely. While I would love to do this long term, I don't think I can handle the lifestyle for more than 2 years at the most.
* I don‚Äôt need a crazy salary‚ÄîI just want a stable, remote-first job that lets me¬†live and work from SEA(South East Asia) legally. If I can make 2800 USD a month, which is how much I make right now after all taxes and deductions, that should be sufficient for me to pursue whatever I want to while still working remotely.



The Problem? Remote PM Jobs Are Almost Nonexistent

1. ¬†Product management jobs are NOT aplenty when it comes to fully remote roles.
   1. Unlike¬†engineering, design, analytics or content roles,¬†remote-first PM jobs are ridiculously rare.
   2. The ones that exist are¬†overwhelmingly based in the US, Canada, or Europe‚Äîmeaning they require work authorization in those places.
   3. PM roles tend to be¬†regional or HQ-based, because companies still expect¬†product managers to be in a specific time zone, work closely with local teams, and attend occasional in-person meetings. I am fine with being available in regular working hours between the UTC +3:30 hours and UTC+7:30 timezones but I am not finding any openings matching this.
2. Most ‚Äúremote‚Äù jobs aren‚Äôt truly remote
   1. Many ‚Äúremote-first‚Äù companies still require you to be based in¬†specific countries or time zones¬†for legal, tax, and operational reasons.
   2. Most PM jobs I find are¬†‚Äúremote within X country or region‚Äù¬†rather than¬†‚Äúwork from anywhere.‚Äù
   3. I am even fine with remote-friendly companies that¬†require hybrid setups or in-person meetups¬†every few months but because of the above 2 points, its super hard to find a job that's feasible.
3. I‚Äôm an Indian citizen, and that limits my options significantly
   1. Unlike EU/US citizens who can work for companies worldwide without visa hassles, I¬†can only legally work for Indian companies¬†or for a foreign company that¬†explicitly hires in India.
   2. If I want to work for a company outside of India¬†while traveling in SEA, I‚Äôd need¬†visa sponsorship or contractor status, which most companies don‚Äôt offer.
   3. Even contract-based roles are tough because companies prefer hiring from¬†cheaper or more accessible regions like Eastern Europe or LATAM¬†over India.
4. Every promising opportunity has fallen through.
   1. I came across a 2/3 openings at companies that have a work from anywhere policy and where the base location is in india. I also found myself to be a very good fit for those openings but they ended up rejecting me.
   2. Every other application either goes¬†unanswered or gets rejected due to location. I've tried companies like Reddit, Github, Hostelworld, Agoda, etc. 



What I‚Äôve Tried So Far

* Applying to remote-first companies¬†like Automattic, GitLab, [Remote.com](http://Remote.com), and Doist‚Äîmost require US/EU work authorization.
* Looking at contract-based remote roles on Toptal, We Work Remotely, and AngelList‚Äîcompetition is insanely high, and PM contract roles are rare.
* Cold emailing hiring managers, networking on LinkedIn, and posting in job-seeking groups‚Äîlimited success, mostly responses saying they don‚Äôt hire in India.
* Exploring Digital Nomad Visas (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia)‚Äîbut none solve my¬†core problem¬†of¬†finding a job that actually lets me work from anywhere.



So, I Need Help From This Community:

* Are there any truly remote-friendly companies hiring PMs regardless of location?
* Has anyone here successfully landed a remote PM job that allows them to work from SEA legally?
* Should I rethink my approach‚Äîfocus on contract work, freelance gigs, or even another role entirely



I feel like I‚Äôm going in circles, and every rejection is making me question whether this is even possible.¬†If anyone has advice, leads, or even just a little reassurance, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.¬†üôèüèº",profetiounal,2025-02-15 12:23:15,0,RemoteWork

Inclement weather,"Opinions on this please:  the company I work for closes the office during inclement weather. Only essential personnel must show up. I work for a department not considered essential personnel. But my department also works remotely. Not our choice. We were told after Covid to continue working remotely permanently. They recently changed their policy so when the company closes due to weather, every non essential worker gets the day off with pay. Not our department. Since we work from home we have to log into work. Fair or unfair?",Signal_Cucumber4628,2025-02-15 05:11:18,0,RemoteWork

Just a thought,"A thought just occurred to me.  Maybe there is a broader plan going on here.  Maybe the plan is to crush wages down by stripping staff with eto mandates so they can then use wfh or hybrid as a bargaining chip - ime.  20k less per year for every monday working from home.  So they teduce wages and enjoy more productivity at the same time.

Maybe the big boys see it as an opportunity to grind down wages - plain and simple.

Some of you might remember how businesses embraced gender diversity,  which imo was just an opportunity for employers to keep wages down - i.e.  they cared more about doubling the labour pool and reducing wages than what people may have assumed - i.e.  they cared about the injustice.

Why are some upset at businesses outsourcing some of their remote positions abroad?,"A few days ago, I had a psycho reddit user endlessly expressing how upset he was at ai and some businesses  outsourcing some of their remote positions abroad.

It seems the user couldn't swallow the pill that there are excellent and talented candidates abroad grateful and willing to do some remote work.

Truth is there are some countries where some individuals who speak excellent English are earning $400-500/month working locally. So an opportunity to earn $1000-$1500/month is massive for them and they are extremely grateful to do it. This is not some exploitative operation. Offering someone an opportunity to earn 3x their usual income while potentially saving money as a company I thought would be understood. Yet, some seem to have a serious problem with it. 

I've been sourcing excellent English speaking talent abroad and I must tell you, the employees and contractors are beyond grateful for an opportunity to double and triple their income especially working from home. I would think it would be a win win win situation where the worker is happy, the company is happy for saving a little bit of money, and I am happy to provide the service. If I can save a company a bit of money, get them quality results while making some one abroad happy, what is so wrong about that?",infobunny1,2025-02-15 01:11:33,0,RemoteWork
Leaving remote job for office job.,"I currently work a remote tech support job for $52k. I haven‚Äôt had a raise in 2 years (no bonuses either), so naturally I started looking for other jobs. 

Ended up getting an offer for $20k more, but it‚Äôs an office job M-F 8-5. Commute is 30mins each way. 

New job is digital marketing so I think I can leverage that with some of my software development skills to earn more in the future. 

Goodbye remote work for the time being! But curious what you would do in this situation? 

ETA: I should add that this new job also has the opportunity for monthly bonuses and and a raise after my first 6 months and then every year after that. ",icedlemin,2025-02-13 17:48:23,44,RemoteWork

Are Time Zones Killing Your Team‚Äôs Productivity? Let‚Äôs Talk About It.,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm a solo dev building a tool to fix time zone headaches for remote teams. After months of research, I know:

‚è≥ Scheduling across time zones is a nightmare.  
üîÅ Rotating meetings fairly is manual (and usually unfair).  
üïí Async deadlines often get misaligned.

But I need **your real-world experiences** üëá

‚ùì Have you ever missed a meeting due to time zones? How often?  
‚ùì Does your team rotate meeting times, or is someone always stuck with odd hours?  
‚ùì How do you handle async deadlines (e.g., ""Submit by 5 PM *your* local time"")?  
‚ùì What frustrates you most about current tools (Calendly, World Time Buddy, etc.)?

Would you use a tool that:  
‚úÖ Auto-rotates meetings fairly?  
‚úÖ Aligns task deadlines per time zone?  
‚úÖ Tracks fairness in scheduling?

You need to actually be good at something to get a remote job,"Can we please ban the style of post that is ‚ÄúI have zero work experience but I want to work remote‚Äù? 

No, you won‚Äôt find anything. Remote work has become rare and everyone wants a remote job. Even customer service jobs require work experience. Employers are taking the best of the best because they can. Insanely skilled workers aren‚Äôt getting remote jobs. Remote jobs have hundreds or even thousands of applicants. FAANG companies are firing people in droves who have entered the job market; what makes you think someone would pick your empty resume for a job over someone from Google?

Data entry jobs are scams, if you are a ‚Äúpersonal assistant‚Äù type you likely are not finding anything, if you just graduated, you likely won‚Äôt pick up a remote job, if you have no specific skills you likely won‚Äôt be able to find a remote job. Take any job you can get, work for 3 to 5 years and get really good and you could get a remote job. OR wait for an employee friendly economy again where everyone is remote, but I wouldn‚Äôt push my luck. Maybe if you are besties with a hiring manager. 

TLDR- if you are unskilled, develop a skill. Then come look for a remote job.

EDIT- I want to be clear that I do have a lot of empathy for folks who are looking for their big break. The world has changed a lot. It used to be you could work your way up from the bottom in an entry level job and be successful, no matter what. Workers are being treated like shit. Remote work is getting harder to find. Even just five years ago, I knew folks that have never had a tech job in their life pick something up and finding success. I wish the world was like that again, but it‚Äôs not, at least not now.

Federal Return to Office and the Ketterer Two-step Framework,"I've been wondering how agencies can just decide to move people who are outside the commuting area without any good reason. In searching for this I came across the below doc:

[https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/handbooks/humanresourcesflexibilitiesauthorities.pdf](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/handbooks/humanresourcesflexibilitiesauthorities.pdf)

This talks about how an ""agency must have a legitimate management need for the reassignment"". This took me to the concept of a ""legitimate management need"" which led me to MSPB cases and all of them cite this ""Ketterer two-step framework"" developed in the case Ketterer v Department of Agriculture where 1. the ""agency had the initial burden of showing that its decision to reassign the employee was based on legitimate management considerations"" and 2. that they had to provide sufficient notice.

My question is, under this framework, what would really be the legitimate management need for all those geographic reassignments? To comply with an EO that's nonsensical? To make people go in to an office to do a job they've successfully done for years? If this is challenged in a class action lawsuit, wouldn't the agencies have to prove that there's a legitimate management need?

Similarly, wouldn't this also apply to them revoking telework without any real rationale?

Edit: here's the Ketterer case for anyone interested, it's a pretty easy/straightforward read. It starts with the appeal then goes into the initial case. Essentially, Ketterer's boss was trying to relocate him but didn't have a real basis for doing so. Ketterer said ""yeah no bro, you're just trying to make me retire because you're a hater."" (sound familiar?). In the initial case, they essentially said ""Agency, you can kick him to the curb for not being cool enough."" In the appeal, the presiding official pretty much said ""Nah agency, y'all are haters you can't do that, you need a legitimate reason of why it's in the agency's best interest to boot my boy. Give that man back his job!""

Freelancing vs. Employment: Freedom or Uncertainty?,"Freelancing is freedom, but it‚Äôs also uncertainty. Unlike traditional employment, there‚Äôs no fixed paycheck, no structured career path‚Äîjust you, your skills, and your ability to adapt. Some days, the flexibility feels like a dream; other days, the lack of stability can be overwhelming.

Do you ever miss the security of employment? Or does the thought of a boss and fixed hours make you shudder?

Freelancing forces you to be everything‚Äîworker, manager, marketer, and accountant. It‚Äôs exhilarating but exhausting. The key is discipline, continuous learning, and building a solid client base.

Maybe employment offers stability, but freelancing gives control. Which is more valuable? And how do you balance the unpredictability of freelancing with long-term security?

If you‚Äôre a freelancer, what‚Äôs your biggest challenge? If you‚Äôre employed, have you ever considered taking the leap? Let‚Äôs talk about the realities‚Äîgood, bad, and everything in between.

2. Has anyone had issues with Microsoft Teams, VPNs, or security tools flagging a foreign IP?

How much do you communicate in your remote job?,"

"AI-Powered Trip Planning: Smart Recommendations for Locations, Hotels, Activities, and Meeting Spaces.","Hi Everyone!

I want to share a great opportunity for Executive Assistants, HR Leaders, and Chief of Staff that go through the grueling hours of planning offsite events for your team.

My company combines the convenience of a planning and retreat service with the practicality of a corporate booking platform. Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for planning group travel for teams of all sizes.



As you know, there is a gap in the market for group travel.

* Booking Platforms are great when you know when and where you are meeting but they are not built for group. Planning group trips with these tools requires hours of research and planning.
* Travel agents and retreat services can be great for large groups; however, they can be extremely expensive, with a $100+ per person cost. Additionally, they are not built for smaller groups (such as leadership retreats) and can feel restrictive with limited options and activities.



My company is the go-to planning and booking tool for your teams. Teams are able able to:

‚Äì Understand the total cost and difference between different destinations in seconds

‚Äì Allow teams to search and price different hotels in seconds

‚Äì Search Airbnb / housing rentals vs hotels

‚Äì Research and book team activities, presenters, or other services when planning an event

‚Äì Book entire company trips with a single click of a button

"Potential fully remote job offer, current hybrid job.","I'm deciding between two jobs. Details below.

I am happy in my current position overall. I have a good team and work/life balance. Current salary is $58k with 21 vacation days. I've been able to move my sick leave from job to job as they are all in the same state system (higher ed) so I have copious sick leave banked. This job is hybrid, two days in the office and three days at home. We also get winter season days, meaning from Christmas Eve to New Year's Day off. There have been rumors of a return to office change, but nothing definitive. I also share an office, so this change could be harder to implement in our department.

The potential new job would be fully remote, and a salary in the low to mid 60k range. I would start at 10 vacation days for the first two years, then slowly increase in amount until at 5+ years where it would max at 22.5 years. You also get your birthday as a paid holiday, and sick leave accrues at 8 hours per month. It's a different state, so I would not get my banked sick leave from current job. From the interview I am interested in the job, it has most of the tasks I like from my current job and does not have a responsibility that I currently hold and don't love. The team seems good, people have been working there for a long time which I take as a good sign. The position was structured as fully remote as they had a hard time finding a strong applicant pool.

I'm considering the new job for more money (although not a ton more), fully remote, and because the position seems like a good fit for my skills. It's possible we could move in the future for my partner's job (although nothing concrete) so the flexibility of a fully remote job for me is appealing. My work is pretty specialized, so it's not easy to find anywhere.

RTO Mandate,"Well it finally happened. I got the email on Friday saying that my company is requiring us to be in office 3 days a week. I have only been going in once per week, mostly to chit chat with coworkers and get lunch. That's enough social interaction for me. I live in the city and the office is in the suburbs and takes over an hour to get there and longer to get home. They do have an office in the city but no one on my team goes there so what's the point? The company said they want ""more collaboration"" and are just following other big companies. I think it's time to start looking for a new job 

The worst part is that they are tracking our badge scans and if we don't comply with 3 days a week, it will affect performance bonuses. I feel like a child being babysat ",WarFast3898,2025-02-10 14:26:56,505,RemoteWork

Check out Our New Article About The Future of Remote Work: Trends to Watch in 2025,"Remote work has changed the way businesses operate. What started as a necessity during the pandemic has now become the preferred way of working for many. As we move into 2025, the future of remote work is still evolving. Businesses are figuring out the best ways to balance flexibility, productivity, and collaboration.

¬†For entrepreneurs, business owners, and small teams, staying ahead of these trends is crucial. Understanding what‚Äôs next can help companies adapt and thrive. Let‚Äôs take a look at the key trends shaping remote work in 2025.

**Hybrid Work is Here to Stay**

Fully remote work isn‚Äôt the reality for most businesses. While some companies still allow employees to work from anywhere, the hybrid model is becoming the new normal. In 2025, more organizations will blend remote and in-office work, allowing employees to split their time between home and the office.

¬†Why? Because hybrid work offers the best of both worlds. Employees get flexibility while businesses maintain in-person collaboration. Studies show that a mix of remote and in-office work leads to higher job satisfaction and better productivity.

Federal RTO is worse than a joke. It‚Äôs a cruel mess.,"DOD has been told to RTO this coming Monday. Distant remote have until either late April or early June to RTO. And in both cases, no one knows if there will be room for anyone. For Monday, there‚Äôs already word that folding tables and chairs will be on hand. And that still may not be enough, especially since many federal agencies, DOD included, have offloaded unused office space.

Now imagine the distant remote folks, many are hundreds of miles from where they would go to the office. Imagine not being told anything until the last minute, having next to no time to pack up your family, and that presumes they can move.

Hopefully sanity will return and people can go back to remote. But it is going to suck for the next few years.

a global list of (free) coworking spaces,"Hi guys,

I've been working remotely for quite some time. It's great, it really is. However I also want to get out of the house sometimes.

Currently living with my girlfriend in a rural area, WeWork is not an option.

So I thought: why don't people host coworking sessions? I cowork with my cousin (who's in a different company) all the time and honestly... it's fun!  
Sure if you're in a meeting every second of every day it gets difficult.

But you might just enjoy sharing your coffee with others in a pressure-free way

So I created a basic google spreadsheet where people can enter coworking sessions. The idea is that anyone can host it and just add a date and contact info in addition to the zip code / country:

Do you guys think this is an interesting idea? Feel free to add columns or whatever you need to make it yours.

Would love to see the first photos of peer-to-peer coworking sessions roll in :)

P.S.: I now realize the title could be misunderstood as list of cafes etc... but feel free to add them! If you have a favorite cafe to work out of, list it!",balancetotheforce99,2025-02-11 14:09:29,2,RemoteWork

How I fixed the endless Zoom meetings problem with async videos,"Been working remotely for 2 years and the biggest pain was always the same - too many meetings that could've been emails... or better yet, quick videos.   
  
Started using Loom for async updates 3 months ago and it changed everything:   
  
Before:   
\- 4-5 hours daily in meetings   
\- constant context switching   
\- timezone nightmare (team across 3 continents)   
  
After:   
\- Down to 1-2 essential meetings/day   
\- Record quick updates when convenient   
\- Team watches when it works for them   
  
The best part? The screen recording feature lets me show exactly what I'm talking about instead of trying to explain in text.   
  
Wish they had better video editing features tho. Sometimes I mess up and have to re-record the whole thing.

My supervisors have praised me that I have excelled in this position as well as complemented me on my willingness to learn other departments even though no required.  I have become the unofficial floater between clinics.  The position I applied for is patient scheduling liaison. So phones and making the doctor‚Äôs schedule and procedures appointments.  I have to do one day in office 4 days can be home.  My children are actually older so I feel guilty using that as a reason.  My husband and I own a small construction business and everyone knows but I didn‚Äôt want them to think I would be using there time to run my business.  Can you guys help me with wording?  For me a hybrid position would help me with my work/ home life balance. My children are older yes but very active in every sport imaginable and I am involved as well.  I am also a wife, mom, business owner, hobby farm owner, and my husband travels a few times a year for work.  ",AdministrationOk9557,2025-02-11 00:10:43,3,RemoteWork

Staying Organized as a Freelancer,"Here's my perspective on staying organized as a freelancer:

* Project Hub: Use a central dashboard (like ClickUp or Asana) to track all deliverables, client communications, and deadlines. Having everything accessible in one system eliminates scattered information.
* Strategic Planning: Block out Monday mornings for weekly planning. Review upcoming deadlines, allocate resources, and identify potential bottlenecks before they become issues.
* Professional Boundaries: Establish clear service hours (e.g., 9am-6pm) and response time expectations. Include these in your client onboarding documents to set expectations early.
* Workflow Automation: Implement tools like Zapier for routine tasks. Use voice dicttation AI tools like [Willow Voice](http://willowvoice.com) or whisper to write emails quickly and client conversations instantly. Save hours on administrative work.
* Redundant Systems: Maintain three-tier backup strategy: cloud storage (like Google Drive), local external drive, and automated backup service (like Backblaze). Protect your work and client assets.

How do you handle the complexity of freelance work? Always curious to learn new approaches for staying efficient.

Maternity leave and work - feeling isolated,"Hello, I'm (28F) 30 weeks pregnant and feeling super isolated at work and not sure what to do. I want to know if this is normal experience for a pregnant person about to go on maternity leave?

I have worked here for 8 months, found out I was pregnant pretty early on and told work when I'd been there 5 months. I passed by 6 month probation fine. They have no idea how my job works. They know it's very important but I don't have a manager to fall back on to ask anything. My manager was a senior business analyst which has nothing to do with my job.

The role was previously very high level manager before but got defunded to the position it is now, and instead of a team of 2-5 it's now just me so I have been VERY stressed. My manager decided I would be better off in the web development team which now has 5 staff and the manager there is absolutely swamped. I haven't had a proper 1:1 in 4 months. No handover or intro meeting to the new manager (I know them personally) but I haven't had any meeting with them regarding properly joining their team calls/meetings or anything about me about to go on maternity leave.

It feels like everyone is ignoring me until I leave or there's no point talking to me (10-11 more weeks of this treatment feels a little painful) I'm just wondering if anyone else got this? I know it can be annoying for the staff who aren't 'going away' for 9 months but it's just generally sucks having emails ignored by old manager, new manager and their manager. Teams messaged left on read about projects I'm doing. They don't care because they have no idea how my job works.

They also decided not to hire anyone for my maternity cover, which I'm not too concerned about I think they are consulting with higher management to reconsider the position being in their teams or something else I don't know. No one will tell me anything about it and I feel very alone right now. I kind of expected it but is this normal behaviour when they know you're going in  3 months time? Although it has been like this since I told them and only gotten more and more ignored as time has gone on.

My holiday requests are also ignored and I can't talk to my manager about when I return or using accrued holiday because he's too busy. What do I do?

I have mentally checked out a bit but I still have 30 odd people chasing me at any one time, as like I said the role is very important to other staff just not to my managers.  I can't progress stuff though because I either need to pay for something to progress a project or need approval but it's just met on deaf ears!

Federal Return to Office and the Ketterer Two-step Framework,"I've been wondering how federal agencies can just decide to move people who are outside the commuting area without any good reason. In searching for this I came across the below doc:

[https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/handbooks/humanresourcesflexibilitiesauthorities.pdf](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/handbooks/humanresourcesflexibilitiesauthorities.pdf)

This talks about how an ""agency must have a legitimate management need for the reassignment"". This took me to the concept of a ""legitimate management need"" which led me to MSPB cases and all of them cite this ""Ketterer two-step framework"" developed in the case Ketterer v Department of Agriculture where 1. the ""agency had the initial burden of showing that its decision to reassign the employee was based on legitimate management considerations"" and 2. that they had to provide sufficient notice.

My question is, under this framework, what would really be the legitimate management need for all those geographic reassignments? To comply with an EO that's nonsensical? To make people go in to an office to do a job they've successfully done for years? If this is challenged in a class action lawsuit, wouldn't the agencies have to prove that there's a legitimate management need?

Similarly, wouldn't this also apply to them revoking telework without any real rationale?

Edit: here's the Ketterer case for anyone interested, it's a pretty easy/straightforward read. It starts with the appeal then goes into the initial case. Essentially, Ketterer's boss was trying to relocate him but didn't have a real basis for doing so. Ketterer said ""yeah no bro, you're just trying to make me retire because you're a hater."" (sound familiar?). In the initial case, they essentially said ""Agency, you can kick him to the curb for not being cool enough."" In the appeal, the presiding official pretty much said ""Nah agency, y'all are haters you can't do that, you need a legitimate reason of why it's in the agency's best interest to boot my boy. Give that man back his job!""

Question about Hubstaff and using multiple desktops in Win 11,"So I've had J1/J2 previously with no monitoring, recently quit J2 due to family emergency and time constraints. 

My general use work computer is a win 11 rig using a 60"" TV as a monitor, Ryzen 5 5600G 20Gb RAM.

Now looking at a J2 for a company that uses Hubstaff. Now I'm very used to using multiple Desktops on Win 11, mainly due to J1 needing me to share screen a lot during meetings. 

Would Hubstaff from J2 on desktop 2 take screenshots of J1 desktop 1???

Information from Google leaves much to be desired revolving around this topic as much of what I've found talks primarily about multiple monitor setups but nothing specifically states multiple desktops. ",EarthCompetitive7134,2025-02-06 23:31:32,3,WorkFromHome

Checking in: What did you all have for breakfast and lunch today as wfh?,"
Since WFH, I rarely eat breakfast at a traditional time. I usually have coffee throughout the early morning then on my morning break grab something a little more substantial.

Today? I made myself a smoothie with lots of fresh fruit. WFH bonus is that I didn't have to buy it for $$ at some cafe nor make it at the crack of dawn, bring it with me, and have it less fresh from a thermos later!

For what lunch I got together with some friends. We had a little potluck. I brought fresh fruit and dessert, and had baked ziti and chicken... And great conversation!! Much nicer than eating by myself in my office, paying $$ at a cafeteria, or eating with coworkers (even though I'm social and pretty much like my co-workers). This turned into a little over an hour, But today is my short day, so it was no problem to add it on at the end of the day.

My spouse was WFH today. He went for a short jog and lunch and ate a protein bar at his desk when he got back.

How about you all? What did your WFH breakfast and lunch meals/times look like?

Energy without caffeine,"Wasn't quite sure where to put this one so I gambled on Exercise and Fitness. 

TL;DR: my question is this: for those who either can't handle, or don't drink, caffeine, and are desk-bound, how do you stay focused* through a full shift? 

*Edited to add that I don't think I have any more difficulty staying awake than most people stuck at a desk for 8 hours, just that most people I know have a steady supply of coffee, Coke, tea, etc, and I've always had a bottle of Diet Mt Dew beside me. 

My WFH  job is at a desk and it's all talkie-talkie and typie-typie, so I am pretty well tethered for the most part, except for scheduled 15-min breaks and 30-min lunch. 

Background: I have some health issues, primarily cardiac in this case, and I have a feeling that in the morning my cardiologist is going to tell me that I'm going to have to give up, or at least cut way back on, caffeine.

I've been playing around with a homemade electrolyte mix, and I really like it, but the sodium level is atrocious.

So I'm open to anything that works for y'all. I've had one friend suggest B-complex, and that's my starting point. Any help is welcome. ",NFiligree,2025-02-05 23:41:43,6,WorkFromHome
Cheap vs. Fancy standing desk for treadmill?????,"High end desk really better? I got a new treadmill but my current desk cant even reach my keyboard while walking. I feel that‚Äôs a bit too small and I don‚Äôt want my walking to be affected

Looking for some thoughts on an ethical dilemma,"So I had a regular job, I was getting tired of and didn't see myself lasting much longer, a couple years at MOST.  I was working on the side as an independent contractor for another guy.  That guy sold his business and they needed someone who knew the business to take over, which naturally was me.  As a contractor I KNEW that the way the guy was running the business was an absolute disaster.  Bookkeeping was a mess, ancient systems that drastically needed updating etc.  I knew it would be a HUGE job to bring this thing into the modern era.  

Guy that bought the company is a big talker sales guy, kinda smarmy really.  I made it very clear that it was going to take a TON of work to update all these systems, we would need programmers, database people, etc. to update it.  Smarmy guy says 'oh yeah we have all that, no problem"".  So I take him at his word (he has a pretty successful business and plenty of money so it would make sense that he would have that kind of back office in place).

So I quit my job that again I didn't care for, but it WAS stable and went to go work for the new operation.  Guess what!  they don't have ANYONE that's a programmer or database expert.  NOBODY!  So now I've quit my job that I can't go back to and I'm stuck rebuilding all of these guys old ancient systems, etc..  So now I'm more than a little bit angry and resentful.

This was a couple years ago, 2 years of the worst years of my life.  As of today I've mostly rebuilt everything from scratch myself, 70-80 hours a week minimum, health went down the toilet, gained 20 pounds and high blood pressure, and possibly alcoholism as well (that one's still up for debate).

I was hired to take over what the previous guy had sold (for multiple 7 figures by the way).  I'm working at a salary that I agreed to based on the lie that a team would be rebuilding everything not me, and not only rebuilding everything but continuing to make it function and adding new features.  So I feel I'm underpaid by about $100k.

So I'm resentful, mad that I was blatantly  lied to, underpaid based on the fact what sounded like a fairly easy job was an absolute nightmare.  Now here's my question.  I have some ideas that could drastically improve the business.  That could make some serious money and add to the bottom line.  But I also know the owner is a sociopathic liar and its highly unlikely any extra profits made would ever make it down to me.  He would tell himself the successful business is due to his awesome business skills, not me creating this much improved product.  So I seriously doubt I'd see a meaningful bump in salary if anything at all.

On the other hand, what is a good employee?  I'm doing what I was hired to do, 100% and even above that.  But I don't feel the need or desire to improve what he paid 7 figures for, since I'll never see any of it.

Get a better routine,"This might be a good post for another sub too so please let me know if you think so.

Ive been working from home and self employed for almost 5 years now. In the beginning I had better structure, but it was never great. 

Now I know I struggle with some health stuff. ADHD, PCOS and alot of anxiety, and I KNOW that can cause all kinds of focus and energy problems, and my job before I quit in 2020 was a corporate nightmear and I feel like I've been burnt out for a solid 10 years at this point. I have very low stress tolerance 

But I just feel like a shell of a human at this point

This is what my daily ""routine"" looks like and it's SO not what I want in my life but I truly feel so lost in how to fix it. I've tried medications, I do see a therapist and i also have coaches and still nothing has really stuck. 

I also just want to note that this post might seem really negative, or like im complaining I'm not trying to do that at all, I'm very open minded and motivated for change. But for the sake of letting you guys help me, I'm going to include some not so positive thoughts that float through my mind on a daily basis. 

6:00 am - my husband wakes up and gets ready for work. Ideally this is when I would like to be getting up too, but it never happens.

8:00 am- my alarm goes off an i press snooze for usually TWO HOURS 

10:00 am- finally i wake up usually in a panic that it's so late and I already start feeling sorry for myself because im sad that once again I ""failed"" the morning. 

10:05 get up to pee 

This is when I try sooo hard to stay out of bed but my body feels like jello and my brain feels like I'm still dreaming.

10:10 go back to bed to scroll on my phone and ""wake up"" 

Anywhere from 10:20-11:30 - finally get out of bed

11:30 - let the dog out, make breakfast and start spiraling about how my day is half over, and put on some sweatpants and never bother to shower lol. 

12:00 - 2:30 peak focus hours with work 

2:30-5:00 really struggling to focus but trying my best, but my productivity drops to like 15% of what it was earlier. Constantly taking adhd side quests lol 

5:00 - husband gets home, hang out with him and have dinner 

anywhere between 7:00 - 8:00 ish - go back to work, still pretty low productivity. Taking LOTS of time to scroll my phone and do other things. Really only a couple hours of real work 

Anywhere from 11:00pm - 1:00am go to bed and scroll on my phone and have bedtime snack (it feels like the first time i really get to rest)  

1am-3am fall asleep 

Im only really getting a solid 4-6 hours of work done a day. But I'm chained to my desk for like 10+ I barely have ""time"" to do anything other than sitting at my desk. I miss my husband, I miss my life. 

My sleep score is usually around the 50 mark and I haven't excersized in almost a year. And I hit the weed vape in the evenings. (Used to be an all day thing but have been slowly quitting)

I know how self destructive this is. I have big goals and im falling short on all of them. The pressure of constant late projects and angry clients kills me. Even as I'm writing this I have something I should be working on.

If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears. I feel like there is an evil monster running my brain who wants to see me fail, and they're winning. 

The simple ""just get up and work"" just has not worked for me no matter how hard I try. My therapist says i should consider shutting down my buisness and I dont want to do that. 

Thanks!

"WFH as a call centre agent, struggling to leave work mentally","Hi guys! I have been working as an inbound agent in a call centre, it's been a while now. I have two questions, was wondering if anyone here could help me.

1. A lot of tips I read were about having a separate area for work and separate for living, so to say. This is not possible in my case, I live in a two room apartment and I have a roommate, I work from my room, I can't afford to live alone right now. I work in a hybrid mode (2 days, always the same, are mandatory for everyone to be in the office), and wouldn't like to switch to 100% in-site as I observed that WFH made me finally get some good sleep.

2. This might be more directed to fellow call centre workers: How do you leave the job behind ""mentally"", so to say? For example, if you encounter a particularly rude customer, what to do so that it doesn't affect how I feel after work? Is there any effective method to keep work and personal life separate in this sense and not let the work affect my personal life?

"Aside from a dedicated home office, from where else do you work within your home?","I found myself today working at a table I set up near our fireplace. Very cozy and a nice change of space. 

Sometimes I work at the dining room table, but usually that's just if my partner happens to be WFH and has a meeting with his camera on (it's rare that that happens).

In summers, I work on the deck some mornings with a cup of coffee, again it's a nice change of space. 

We have a portable monitor but I don't like to be bothered setting it up. So when I leave the home office it's almost always when I can work and do not need the second monitor.

Will this USB-C switch setup work for connecting two laptops to monitors?,"Hey Reddit,

I'm currently using a Lenovo laptop connected to two monitors via a USB-C dock, and it works perfectly. Now, I want to connect *two laptops* (work and personal) to the same setup and switch between them.

Here's my idea:

* Use a **USB-C switch** to toggle between the two laptops.
* The switch will connect to my USB-C dock, which outputs to the two monitors and also handles peripherals (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

Before I buy the switch, I want to confirm if this setup will work. Will a USB-C switch support video (DisplayPort Alt Mode) and allow me to switch both the monitors and peripherals between laptops seamlessly?

Both laptops have USB-C ports that support DisplayPort Alt Mode.

Has anyone tried something similar? Any recommendations for a reliable USB-C switch or KVM that works for this kind of setup?

Thanks in advance!

Disadvantages of Working From Home,"Recently I got COVID from my neighbor. My job's policy is that you need a doctor's note if you want time off from work if you're sick, if you don't want to take a hit on your attendance. So long story short, I went to the hospital to get a doctor's note and they tested me for COVID and the flu. 

The test came back as positive and they told me to rest for 5 days. I messaged my supervisor and gave her the work note, (which the hospital screwed up and only did for one day), and they told me that the note was only good for one day and that unless I worked the next 5 days I would be penalized. 

I told my manager that was fine and I would be showing up to work, (hybrid schedule), bright and early the next morning and they said I wouldn't be allowed to do that because I had COVID to which I responded that if I was well enough to work from home I was well enough to work in the office. 

They told me it is what it is and I need the note or I'd be in trouble so I decided that was it. I told them that they could be okay with losing an employee for a few days or they could lose an employee permanently and that it was their decision. They finally grudgingly conceded and gave me the time off. Thoughts on this? ",BeneficialHair1895,2025-01-23 18:38:45,1,WorkFromHome

Home Office Lifesaver,"I live in a rural area where power outages are common and sometimes extended. I also work from home at at tech related job where I must be on my computer online in order to do my job. If the power is out, I'm not working. I needed a reliable backup power solution that I could get in place quickly if a power outage occurred. So I bought a solar generator and I've already needed it several times. My entire home office (labtop, two external monitors, two printers, plus additional accessories) is connected to a surge suppressor which I'm able to easily switch from the wall connection to my Jackery E3000 PRO.

They have already proven to be lifesavers for my work and home living. And preparing a generator in advance can really provide you with a lot of help when facing sudden disasters. For example, the wildfire in California this time also caused large-scale power outages in many surrounding areas.

After years inside a windowless office, it's amazing to have natural light and see outside. If the weather were warmer, I could get fresh air, as well.  
It's so peaceful. If I want, I can listen to music or podcasts *without headphones.* My old office was noisy and cliquish; now I don't have to deal with the drama and chatter.  *I can use my own bathroom.* I don't have to deal with the nasty break room. No brown bagging it. I wear what I want, no dress code.  
I can sleep later and feel so much more relaxed starting my workday, since I don't have to rush around gathering everything up to leave.  
And the big one, no driving to work in bad weather! I can sip coffee while looking out at a snowfall, where I used to stress about the state of the roads.  

What I miss: Some friends, and friendly faces. I do think it's possible this will come to weigh more as time goes by. But I can stay in touch with my friends if so desired.

Is this unreasonable?,"Hi people who work from home, have you encountered quite unreasonable micromanagement especially when they work from home? I am honestly speechless at how my manager speaks. So I was working in office in the morning and asked to work from home in the afternoon, which my manager has approved. My commute from work to home takes an hour, and so after reaching home I went for lunch as it coincides with the one hour lunch break. There was a queue at lunch and also I had to see a doctor because I have been suffering from a bad cough. I also had to commute back home after lunch which was another half an hour. During this entire time, I could not respond to work at all because I was busy commuting and having lunch and seeing the doctor. I came back to work and the response from my manager was where have I been in 3 hours? I honestly think it is reasonable to take 3 hours including my commute home from work and from lunch, lunch and the queue, and seeing the doctor. I explained and she wants to speak to me tomorrow. I am exhausted, are all managers like this? Monitoring to the second and minute? She also is clearly aware that I'm having a bad cough as I did cough a lot while in office and she even asked me to wear a mask. I am now nervous about what she is going to say to me tomorrow. 

Please advice on how normal this is for those working from home.",bananaisme106,2025-01-16 09:30:54,1,WorkFromHome
Potential switch from fully remote position to hybrid,"Hi everyone, 

Just to start off with I work in a company which is in a slow-paced environment and is relatively stable.

The company is only 10 minutes away from where I live and I have to be in the office twice per week. The only thing that I want to change is because I feel that I am not learning anything for the past 6 months and I am in the mid twenties where I would like to have so dynamic in my work.

Advice on WFH set-up: Small/foldable(?) office chair,"I am starting a new job that has lots of flexibility for me to work from home when I need/want. However, my partner also works full-time from home and we don't have a ton of room. Right now, my WFH set-up is me using my dresser as a standing desk lol. We have enough room for a small table/desk for me to use in the bedroom, and I have a table where the leaves fold down so I can like ""pack up"" my desk when I don't want everything to be out and taking up as much space. However, my office chair feels like it takes up a lot of space and isn't easy to put somewhere out of the way. I am wondering if anyone has any recommendation for smaller-low profile chairs, or an ideally a folding chair that can be put in a closet when I'm not using it to work, but that is still somewhat comfortable/ergonomic for working on a computer.

Why is WFH never discussed in terms of climate change and health risks?,"When I think of the benefits of WFH, I immediately think of the reduction in vehicle emissions and power/resources used at offices. What a great way to improve air quality in urban areas and try to combat climate change. My previous career required me to drive around a major city all day every day. 

My husband left for the office this morning and someone crossed center line on our narrow road and took off his mirror. I'm SO glad it wasn't more serious. It's crazy to think he could have died driving to a job that can be done from home. How many injuries and deaths could be avoided by allowing people to not commute who don't need to.

Can‚Äôt focus ,"I have the option to work from home (which I try to do to save on gas from an hour + long commute each day), and at 32 hours a week, this feels like a great way to have work/life balance.

However, when I'm working remotely, getting all of my billable hours in each day is a really challenging task. I have diagnosed ADHD, and even with my medicine, I seriously struggle to work an 8 hour day from home.

My attempt today left me with 3.25 billable hours, and I now have to distribute those throughout the rest of the week, definitely taking my work week into Friday.

It was sunny out today, and I kept trying to work but looked longingly at the sun but didn't get out in it. Something something self sabotage...
When I'm in the office it can be hard to focus because of the hustle and bustle and folks having loud conversations that are distracting, but l generally am able to spend 8 hours there and get 8 billable hours in when I drive in.

Unfortunately, I had a car totaled a few months back. I was driving home from work at night when a deer unexpectedly bounded into my path on a dark highway. Even though I am more productive in the office, I am hesitant to go in and drive back so late. With the sun still setting around 4:45, it's really hard to make it back home before dark.

Am I in the feelings stage about it or am I in the solutions oriented phase? Hard to say, perhaps a little bit of both. I don't like this feeling of throwing off my work week so significantly.
Thank you for the space to vent it out, all! If there are any helpful thoughts anyone has to share, I appreciate your perspectives and kind words. ",None,2025-01-15 05:25:27,0,WorkFromHome
Office small talk vent ,"I go into the office once day a week for about three hours. Today was that day. In the three hours I was there, one guy made me look at pictures of his roof for 15 minutes, and then proceeded to talk about his roof for another 20 minutes (the times are not an exaggeration - it was literally 35 minutes of him having me cornered to talk about his roof). After that ended, a woman stopped by my desk to show me pictures of a bridal shower she was at this weekend. That took another 20 minutes. When I walked past the lobby desk on my way to the copier, the receptionist decided she just had to tell me about how the mailman brought the wrong mail into the building twice last week. On my walk back to my desk, the maintenance man stopped me to ask how I've been enjoying the cold weather.

I am not a people person to begin with, but these unsolicited conversations make me rage. I don't CARE about your roof or your bridal shower and I certainly don't want to see pictures of them. It doesn't matter to me if the mailman brought the wrong mail or if the office is getting new mini blinds. I don't WANT to be distracted when I'm trying to get something done. I want to get in, do what I have to do as quickly and efficiently as possible, and then I want to leave. 

I am so, so, SO grateful that I only have to go into the office for these three hours every week so I feel bad even complaining. I can't believe I used to deal with this nonstop chatter 40 hour a week when I worked in person.

For me, it‚Äôs the ability to tackle small chores throughout the day. Stuff like switching laundry, emptying the dishwasher, grabbing the mail, and putting things away. Getting all those little tasks done bit by bit during the workday means that when I‚Äôm finished with work, everything is already taken care of.

What are the best (or worst) file management solutions for remote work?,"I‚Äôm part of a small business, and we‚Äôre looking for a better solution for file management with remote employees (me being one of them, and partially responsible for this as part of an update to our internal systems).

We‚Äôve quickly chatted about things like expending our already diverse system using Western Digital drives and GoodSync, switching to the Microsoft ecosystem including SharePoint, and switching to the Google ecosystem.

Workplace advice,"So recently I started a new job and it‚Äôs a job from work at home full-time.

And when I tell you that this supervisor made me feel so stupid and dumb every single time that he‚Äôd offer to help me it‚Äôs literally horrible because I‚Äôm asking a supervisor for help but you‚Äôre basically giving me a lecture on why I shouldn‚Äôt do something a certain way. Never the less, I‚Äôd have to repeat my question like ten times bc they go on a rant for something completely different instead of answering the question that I had from the beginning. Do you think it‚Äôs okay for me to basically speak my mind to other supervisors about me not wanting to ask for help in fear of getting that supervisor?

Working from home became impossible,"So, I'm a very active person. I have always studied different things, have been working since I was 15 (I'm about to turn 21), and get bored fast and want to move to a different enviroment.

I worked as an administrative in real state and in an attorneys firm. Then I worked for a NGO, as a facer in the street collecting donations.

Last year, I finally got a very good job, working from home as an interpreter (translator). Like a call center, I recieve calls from medical proffessionals who need help with their patients who don't speak their language. It can be inside the medical room or administrative tasks, even emergency calls.

Last year I was in a company with a fixed schedule, working a few pre-fixed hours, getting payed at the end of the month. That worked out so well! It was very stressful and consuming, but only a few hours in and then I had the rest of the day, and made so much more money that if I was working another job. The thing is, I made a trip to Europe for the summer and had to quit that job, was told to re-apply when I was back. When I got back, oof, it was so so hard. But then I recieved an offer from another company, same job but a higher pay, so I took it. The only problem, this company is free lance and I don't have a fixed schedule. I work when I like, the time I like, and that's so hard to keep up.

I'm an actress on top of all, I study many arts and have been working in many theater plays while working this other jobs. Since this company is free lance, I just can't bring myself to do it. I have spent multiple days, even weeks without working. I have got small jobs singing and performing in parties to mantain myself, but my income has decreased a lot - I was living on my own and had to move out due to problems with violent neighbors, so back at living with my mom, I don't have the same financial responsibilites that I had before, and this makes things even harder.

I have tried everything, working at different time of the day, setting alarms, working in sets of fewer hours during the day, nothing seems to work. I really need the money, but I just can't work this job anymore. I will wake up at 8, sit down at the computer (it's in a whole different room, I have tried that too) and just won't be able to work. I have booked another jobs, went in for a few days, just dropped becasue they're not as good as the one I have.

I get told that everytime, everyone just tells me they want my job, that it's so easy, that everyone gets tired after a while but it's such a good offer. I know, but it's just a demanding job. You cannot be passive, you have to be listening, translating, thinking ALL the time. No breaths. I can't even drink my coffee sometimes. Everyone says that I just have to do it, and that this is the best I'll get, best than any other job, but truly, I'm miserable and tired and anxious all day. My mental health is not the best at the moment and I think this job just contributes to that. This is the longest I've been working the same job, besides acting, one year and a half in translating.

Maybe I'm just whining and this is actually simple, but I wanted to vent a little and also share my problem.

What do you do when everyone tells you you already have the best job offer you'll get?

thank you for reading!

Enforcing carpooling coworker??,"So I wfh primarily with occasional travel to various events and stuff throughout the province. I have a co worker who also attends these events with me. This coworker lives about 30-40 mins west of me so we usually just meet up at the destination, do whatever we need to do and then leave. I love driving over by myself** and coming back alone as well, it's a nice way for me to mentally prepare for the day and then decompress otw back. This coworker keeps trying to push carpooling onto me and it's really annoying. I'm not very close to this person either, and absolutely do not want to spend more time than I have to with them making unnecessary small talk. I hate that. We also spend the entire day together when we're at these events, which require us to talk to each other and everyone else attending almost nonstop. It's incredibly over stimulating so I needd my alone time when im driving back especially. I've managed to make up excuses to not carpool up until now but I'm running out of things to say and just need to tell this person straight up that I am not into this carpooling business. This person has also brought this up to my manager during their one on ones (like totally unnecessary???) who also then casually brought it up to me, recommending that it would be nice, more efficient, etc etc. Now I want to carpool with them even less.

Frustrated with work/life balance with involuntary promotion (a rant),"Hi I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to post a rant lol but I‚Äôm annoyed.

For context, I joined my company four years ago. The position was strictly WFH, as the company decided to close its home office permanently during COVID. I really enjoy working for my manager. She‚Äôs really easy going and likes me, the work/life balance is great because I get my work done with no issues, etc.

Two years ago, we were acquired by our now parent company (which is based across the country). It didn‚Äôt really affect me because they weren‚Äôt laying off our department because we‚Äôre needed and my work/life balance didn‚Äôt change. I got promoted after two years and I‚Äôve been in my position for another two years.

Last month I was promoted and moved to the corporate team. I wasn‚Äôt offered the position, it was based on need so I wasn‚Äôt offered a chance to accept/reject the promotion. The work I was doing was going to transition over to the parent company anyway, they were looking for managers, and I was performing well. I‚Äôm going to be under a new manager and my team is three hours ahead of me (I‚Äôm west coast and they are east coast).

I haven‚Äôt fully transitioned over because I need to finish the fiscal year with my old team; however I started having one-on-ones with my new manager. As nice as he is, it‚Äôs making me want to quit but I really can‚Äôt in this job market. We are expected to work some weekends and they want to fly me out to corporate. I know I‚Äôm being whiny and ungrateful, but I‚Äôm frustrated because I joined the company at a slightly lower salary than I could get at another company. The caveat was I got to work from home and never travel. Up till now I didn‚Äôt have to worry about working weekends and traveling. My new manager is also online working late hours everyday and I‚Äôm not okay with that. I‚Äôm fine working late every once in a while, but I left my old company because I was consistently working 10-12 hours in the office.

I have bills to pay and the job market isn‚Äôt great right now so I don‚Äôt see myself leaving. However I needed to vent so I am incredibly sorry if I sound out of touch. Just annoyed lol",vietnamesebbg,2025-01-02 20:23:10,33,WorkFromHome

* Jabra Evolve 75
* Jabra Engage 75
* Poly Voyager Focus 2

Looking around, the Jabra models have been updated several times since these came out, but I'm also hearing that many of the updates have had big issues. The Poly was considerably cheaper than the others, but I'm also hearing good things about it. There won't be any issue if I return all 3 and get something else entirely. Is it worth getting something else, or is the Evolve 75 still solid for the price in 2025? Is there something reliable and with a good mic that's better than the Evolve 75 in the 200-250 range?

Does one make it easier? It can, but only if you‚Äôre willing to stand and work. Standing desks aren‚Äôt for everyone. They can be expensive, but so is rehabbing your body out of a slowly developed injury. Ask yourself what your long-term use will be and how much you value your health. Decide from ther.

**How to Choose the Right Standing Desk**

Choosing the perfect standing desk can be overwhelming, especially with so many options available. To make the process easier, here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to the key factors you should consider.

**1. Frame and Desktop Basics**

A standing desk consists of two main parts: the frame and the desktop. These are often sold separately, allowing flexibility in your choices.

* If you already have a desktop, you can purchase just the frame and pair it with your existing surface.
* If you buy both together from the brand‚Äôs website, you often get combo discounts and pre-drilled holes, making assembly easier.

Do pre-drilled holes matter? Not really. Self-tapping screws work just fine without damaging your desktop. While some users add threaded inserts for easier disassembly when moving, it‚Äôs generally unnecessary. For instance, FlexiSpot desks are designed to let you remove the legs without taking apart the entire frame, simplifying relocation.

**2. How to Choose a Frame**

The frame is the backbone of any standing desk. When choosing a frame, consider these four key factors:

**Stability**

The most critical factor for a standing desk. Stability depends on:

* Leg stages: Three-stage legs are more stable than two-stage ones due to better overlap between segments at standing height.
* Four-leg frames: These provide up to 30% more stability than two-leg models.
* Build quality: Heavier and thicker frames are generally sturdier. If you‚Äôre unsure, compare the weights‚Äîheavier frames often mean better stability.

**Lifting Capacity**

While this doesn‚Äôt directly affect stability, it impacts performance. Desks with higher lifting capacities (e.g., 400 lbs or more) put less strain on the motor, extending its lifespan. Aim to keep the motor running at under 70% of its capacity for optimal durability.

**Height Range**

Ergonomics matter for both sitting and standing positions. Use these guidelines:

* Sitting height: Your height (in inches) √∑ 2.5
* Standing height: Your height √ó 0.6

Shorter users should look for desks with a low minimum height (e.g., FlexiSpot E7 starts at 22.8 inches, ideal for users 4'8"" and above). Taller users should prioritize higher maximum heights (e.g., FlexiSpot E7 Pro goes up to 50.6 inches, suitable for users up to 6'5"").

**Width Adjustability**

A good frame should last over a decade, so choose one with adjustable width for future flexibility. Fixed-width frames might limit your options and cause overhang issues. Ideally, your desktop should be 10 inches wider than the frame for balance and stability.

**3. Choosing the Right Desktop**

Desktops come in various materials, each with pros and cons:

* Chipboard: Affordable, widely available, and durable for 3‚Äì4 years.
* Bamboo: Eco-friendly, durable, and offers a unique natural appearance.
* Solid wood: Offers the best aesthetics and longevity, especially hardwoods like rubberwood. It‚Äôs a cost-effective alternative to premium woods like walnut.

**4. Motors: Single vs. Dual**

Standing desks may feature single or dual motors, and some even have four motors. While the number of motors doesn‚Äôt directly impact stability, it affects speed and load capacity.

* Single-motor desks: Often lighter and less stable due to cost-saving designs like thinner legs.
* Dual-motor desks: Better for heavier setups and smoother adjustments.

Keep your total setup weight under 70% of the frame‚Äôs capacity, and the difference between single and dual motors becomes less significant.

**5. Warranties: Do They Matter?**

Warranties can be misleading in the standing desk market. Many brands advertise long warranties (10‚Äì15 years), but these don‚Äôt always reflect actual durability. Here‚Äôs why:

* Industry trends: Most brands source their desks from third-party factories and focus on marketing rather than long-term support.
* Brand longevity: Some companies might not last long enough to honor their warranties. Choose established brands with a proven track record.
* Product durability: With proper care, most desks can last 10‚Äì15 years regardless of the warranty period.

"My friend, who is an HR professional at some company, offered me a WFH job. However, I am not completely eligible for it, so he advised me to use AI tools to crack the interview. Should I do it? I am clearly confused on Morality Grounds. What should I do? Please Advise me, Guys.","I am in real stress. I have been looking for a job for quite some time and now my friend who is an HR has given me an opportunity to appear for an interview at his company. But I am not completely eligible for the position and to crack the interview he asked me to take help from AI tools like LockedIn AI, Mockup,etc. 



But I am really confused and stressed. As this is not morally right, I don't know if I can do this or not. I need this job but even if I get it, will I be able to work longer there? And also, what if I start feeling more guilty than now?



Please advise me.....",Numerous-Trust7439,2024-12-22 20:45:37,10,WorkFromHome
Short term relocation question,"Hi friends! I work in a remote position at CVS and was wondering if anyone has input or experience regarding moving? My fiance will be spending 4-5 months in another state than the one that I was hired in (TX), but I am fully remote. I don‚Äôt foresee this being an issue but I was wondering if anyone had thoughts or experience with something like this? The policy says a move has to be approved but I can‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ thoughts? TIA",Pale-Panic-8383,2024-12-23 02:48:53,2,WorkFromHome
